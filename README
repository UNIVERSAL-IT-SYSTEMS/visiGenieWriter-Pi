
Small command line utility to send data to a 4D Systems display running a VisiGenie project.
Allows shell scripts to easily send data to a display.

Requires the 4D Systems ViSi-Genie-RaspPi library be already installed as shown at:
	https://github.com/4dsystems/ViSi-Genie-RaspPi-Library

Parameters:
	-w Write Object (not implemented yet)
	-i Object Index
	-s String
	-o Object type, either the object type value from geniePi.h, or the constant excluding the "GENIE_OBJ_" and in lower case
	-v The value to be sent
	-x Don't cleanly close the connection to genie, speeds things up but not great ...
	All non-named paramters are concatenated into a single string which is used for the value if
		the -v parameter is not set. Note that extra spaces are discarded (unless quoted).
	The value can also be read from stdin, this is done until EOF is read, and only done if
		-v is not defined and no non-named parameters are provided i.e. it's the last resort
		to get the value to send.
	So in order of preference for getting value:
		1 - the -v parameter
		2 - concatenation of space seperated non-named parameters
		3 - stdin

Example Usage:
	Writes a string to the String3 of the display:
		visiGenieWrtie -s -i3 -v"The string you want to write"
	Same but without defining -v:
		visiGenieWrtie -s -i3 The string you want to write
	Writes 55 to Slider0 of the dispaly:
		visiGenieWrite -oslider -o0 -v55
	The same as above but the value is read from stdin:
		echo 55 | visiGenieWrite -oslider -o0
